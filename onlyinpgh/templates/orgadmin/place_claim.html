Claim place form

Just a simple form with one field: place

Also needs two buttons: one for submitting the place that you're claiming 
(the default submit button), and one to just move to create a new 
blank page. Doesn't have to be a button, could be a link, whatever. I 
just need the submit button to be the user claiming a place.

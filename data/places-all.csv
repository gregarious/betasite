Originally, the mission was to enhance the integrity of the community through communications and negotiation among residents, merchants and institutional representatives. Peoples Oakland was very successful in its early organizing efforts, leading to the development of several community wide planning structures which still operate today. The Peoples Oakland Mental Health Program was founded in response to the crisis faced by thousands of state mental hospital patients who, through de-institutionalization programs, were released into the community with few supporters or social connections. Peoples Oakland began to organize former patients, providing education to support them in advocating for the rights.",Community,1

Joe Mama's Italian Deluxe,3716 Forbes Ave.,,,,http://www.joemamas.com/revised%20images/main_new.gif,(412) 621-7282,http://www.joemamas.com/,"Joseph Michael Mama was born into a first generation Italian-American immigrant family...way back when. He won't tell us the exact date because he's scared we'll throw him a party. Joe's kind of a grumpy guy. He's got plenty of other faults too, but we won't bore you with them. Actually, most things about Joe are pretty average except his weight, which is a little above average. To be perfectly honest with you, we only know of two things that Joe does really well. One is bowling, which we'll get back to later. The other is cooking the kind of food he grew up on - great big platters of authentic Home Style Italian-American Grub. Honestly, nobody cooks Italian like Joe Mama! Joe learned everything he knows from his Mom and Nonna (That's Italian for Grandma). He says he can't remember a day growing up when those two weren't in the kitchen with a big pot of something good simmering on the stove. Their modest home was always filled with extended family and friends. There was always plenty of heated debate (yelling) and even more laughter. Most importantly, there was the food. We're talking huge platters of delicious Made-From-Scratch Italian Food. (Not to mention, endless jugs of Homemade Wine.) Joe always tells us, ""we were pretty close to poor, but we ate like kings."" And, that's why he always gives you an honest meal for the buck. You'll think Joe's crazy when you see the food. Back to the bowling...Joe's a real champ. If you don't believe us, check out all the trophies. They're around here somewhere. Joe's the captain of his team, The Bombers. He never misses league night. (Although, sometimes we miss Joe the morning after league night.) The Bombers team slogan is, ""We're a drinkin' team with a bowling problem."" That pretty much sums it up for you. In the Army, Joe was a Mechanic Crew Sergeant on a B-47 Bomber (Hence, the name for his team.) When he got out, he took over this place with the help of one of those low interest VA loans. That was a long time ago and the place was old then. Back to the bowling...Joe's a real champ. If you don't believe us, check out all the trophies. They're around here somewhere.

That was a long time ago and the place was old then. Other than a couple of expansions over the years, not much about this joint has changed. Believe us, we know it's not much to look at. (Joe always says, ""the food's good looking enough!"") On the up side, there's no chance of really messing anything up. So relax, listen to some of Joe's tunes, have one of our Famous Tall Cocktails, and most importantly, eat a big platter of some real Home Style Grub. If you get some sauce on your shirt, don't worry... you'll blend right in.",food;bar;alcohol;restaurant;italian;beer,1

In 1973 staff was added which included two chefs who continue to prepare authentic dishes in our kitchen today. Extensive remodeling took place in 1975 and 1982, which changed Ali Baba’s décor into what is seen presently.

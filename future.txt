A catch all text file for things that should be considered once there's an actual release candidate around:

	- For now, no. Problems with Deferred. The flexibility in foundation development that Deferred gives us makes it necessary to keep around until a RC is done. At this point, re-evaluating the need for Deferred would be good.

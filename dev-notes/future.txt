A catch all text file for things that should be considered once there's an actual release candidate around:

- Use of Zepto instead of jQuery.
	- For now, no. Problems with Deferred. The flexibility in foundation development that Deferred gives us makes it necessary to keep around until a RC is done. At this point, re-evaluating the need for Deferred would be good.

- Root through boilerplate code for app and site to remove anything unnecessary.

- Consider what code needs to be marked safe and what needs to be escaped. For now just marking everything that comes from a rendering.* function as safe.

- Learn details about models. Lean custom fields. Learn cleaning. (e.g. application: Add state fullname to abbrev translation into Place saving core)

- Another good model edition: address normalization for each Location. Or at least a flag to mark one as normalized.

- Take a big look at events/outsourcing/facebook code. missing a lot of error checking i fear

- Field-specific sync Meta for Facebook/iCal events. Doing this right will mean really making the link between Facebook/iCal and Scenable easy for two way communication.

- Read through https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/security/, especially the SSL/HTTPS section to get automatic https forwarding and secure cookies working. Also take a look at "Host headers and virtual hosting"

- Use the new wsgi setting in settings.py to make the dev server also use the custom wsgi file

- cacheing leads: Varnish (recommended from Tastypie)

- write custom django pipeline class that gzips scripts? does this really not exist?

- LOTS more haystack reading. not doing anything intersting yet.

A catch all text file for things that should be considered once there's an actual release candidate around:

- Use of Zepto instead of jQuery. 
	- For now, no. Problems with Deferred. The flexibility in foundation development that Deferred gives us makes it necessary to keep around until a RC is done. At this point, re-evaluating the need for Deferred would be good.

- Launch app with latest version of Phonegap, and other js libraries.

- Root through boilerplate code for app and site to remove anything unnecessary.

- Unit tests for EVERYTHING after launch. EEEEVVVERYTHING.

- Consider what code needs to be marked safe and what needs to be escaped. For now just marking everything that comes from a rendering.* function as safe.

- Look into automating more Model+ViewModel's to_data with new flatten handlers

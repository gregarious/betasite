		<h2>Our goal is to create a Community Network</h2>
		<p>An online platform that connects the web of communities which make up a place and presents them in a straightforward and easy-to-use way.</p>

		<p><strong>For individual communities</strong>, the network provides an online home that pulls together the pieces of information about the community spread all over the internet, allowing the community to take ownership of its online presence and become a digital destination.</p>

		<p><strong>For individual users</strong> the network provides an online way to keep up with and participate in the communities they know as well as discover and participate in communities theyâ€™re less familiar with.</p>

		<p>After all, cities are just a collection of communities, and communities come in many flavors, shapes and sizes. What often defines our experience in a city is how well we connect to these communities, and the easier that process is, the better for everyone.</p>

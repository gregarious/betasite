{% extends "base.html" %}

Template for any Scenable webpage. 

Context variables:
	- main_content: HTML string

Purposefully an trivial wrapper around base.html. base.html should handle
all the browser-based plumbing boilerplate in the header/footer, leaving 
page.html to handle the basic skeleton for page content. Right now that
skeleton is almost empty, but it may not always be.

This will encourage to sticking to a particular page layout for all
standard Scenable pages. If there are special cases that should follow
their own rules, these special cases can become new base.html child 
themes that won't have to worry about browser-level boilerplate code.

Take home messsage: No views should render to base.html, but any
whole page response should render to this.
